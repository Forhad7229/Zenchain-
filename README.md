## 📌 Project Overview

Zenchain DApp demonstrates the following:

- Creation and deployment of a custom ERC20 token smart contract  
- Implementation of a Token Lock contract to restrict transfers temporarily  
- Automated testing using Hardhat framework  
- Deployment scripts tailored for Zenchain testnet  
- Basic integration support for frontend DApps via Web3 or Ethers.js
